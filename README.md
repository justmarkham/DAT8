-----

### Class 2: Command Line and Version Control
* Slack tour
* Review the command line pre-class exercise ([code](code/02_command_line.md))
* Git and GitHub ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Intermediate command line

**Homework:**
* Complete the [command line homework assignment](homework/02_command_line_chipotle.md) with the Chipotle data.
* Review the code from the [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) Python workshops. If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (excluding the "requests" and "APIs" sections), you should spend some time this weekend practicing Python:
    * [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/) does a great job explaining Python essentials and includes tons of example code.
    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
    * If you have more time, try missions 2 and 3 from [DataQuest's Learning Python](https://www.dataquest.io/course/learning-python) course.
    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) number 1 (decoding a message) and send me your code in Slack.
* To give you a framework for thinking about your project, watch [What is machine learning, and how does it work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk) (10 minutes). (This is the [IPython notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/01_machine_learning_intro.ipynb) shown in the video.) Alternatively, read [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/), which focuses on a specific machine learning model called decision trees.
* **Optional:** Browse through some more [example student projects](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples), which may help to inspire your own project!

**Git and Markdown Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Cracking the Code to GitHub's Growth](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/github) explains why GitHub is so popular among developers.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.

**Command Line Resources:**
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032823.do) is a great book. The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox" (a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via `pip`.

-----

### Class 3: Data Reading and Cleaning

    * Spyder interface
    * Looping exercise
    * Lesson on file reading with airline safety data ([code](code/03_file_reading.py), [data](data/airlines.csv), [article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/))
    * Data cleaning exercise
    * Walkthrough of Python homework with Chipotle data ([code](code/03_python_homework_chipotle.py), [data](data/chipotle.tsv), [article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html))

**Homework:**
* Complete the [Python homework assignment](code/03_python_homework_chipotle.py) with the Chipotle data, add a commented Python script to your GitHub repo, and submit a link using the homework submission form. You have until Tuesday (9/1) to complete this assignment. (**Note:** Pandas, which is covered in class 4, should not be used for this assignment.)

**Resources:**
* [Want to understand Python's comprehensions? Think in Excel or SQL](http://blog.lerner.co.il/want-to-understand-pythons-comprehensions-think-like-an-accountant/) may be helpful if you are still confused by list comprehensions.
* [My code isn't working](http://www.tecoed.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/624506_orig.png) is a great flowchart explaining how to debug Python errors.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.
* If you want to understand Python at a deeper level, Ned Batchelder's [Loop Like A Native](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html) and [Python Names and Values](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html) are excellent presentations.

* Read [How Software in Half of NYC Cabs Generates $5.2 Million a Year in Extra Tips](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/107245431809/how-software-in-half-of-nyc-cabs-generates-5-2) for an excellent example of exploratory data analysis.
* Read [Anscombe's Quartet, and Why Summary Statistics Don't Tell the Whole Story](http://data.heapanalytics.com/anscombes-quartet-and-why-summary-statistics-dont-tell-the-whole-story/) for a classic example of why visualization is useful.

**Resources:**
* Browsing or searching the Pandas [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) is an excellent way to locate a function even if you don't know its exact name.
* [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) is a fun (yet enlightening) look at the process of exploratory data analysis.

* This notebook demonstrates the different types of [joins in Pandas](notebooks/05_pandas_merge.ipynb), for when you need to figure out how to merge two DataFrames.
* This is a nice, short tutorial on [pivot tables](https://beta.oreilly.com/learning/pivot-tables) in Pandas.
* For working with geospatial data in Python, [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/index.html) looks promising. This [tutorial](http://michelleful.github.io/code-blog/2015/04/24/sgmap/) uses GeoPandas (and scikit-learn) to build a "linguistic street map" of Singapore.

**Visualization Resources:**
* Watch [Look at Your Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coNDCIMH8bk) (18 minutes) for an excellent example of why visualization is useful for understanding your data.
* For more on Pandas plotting, read this [notebook](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_7-Plotting-with-Pandas.ipynb) or the [visualization page](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) from the official Pandas documentation.
* To learn how to customize your plots further, browse through this [notebook on matplotlib](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_4-Matplotlib.ipynb) or this [similar notebook](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb).
* Read [Overview of Python Visualization Tools](http://pbpython.com/visualization-tools-1.html) for a useful comparison of Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, ggplot, Bokeh, Pygal, and Plotly.
* To explore different types of visualizations and when to use them, [Choosing a Good Chart](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf) and [The Graphic Continuum](http://www.coolinfographics.com/storage/post-images/The-Graphic-Continuum-POSTER.jpg) are nice one-page references, and the interactive [R Graph Catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/) has handy filtering capabilities.
* This [PowerPoint presentation](http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/DataMining/Columbia2011/Slides/Topic2-EDAViz.ppt) from Columbia's Data Mining class contains lots of good advice for properly using different types of visualizations.
* [Harvard's Data Science course](http://cs109.github.io/2014/) includes an excellent lecture on [Visualization Goals, Data Types, and Statistical Graphs](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/L03/screen_H264LargeTalkingHead-16x9.shtml) (83 minutes), for which the [slides](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7IVstmtIvlHLTdTbXdEVENoRzQ/edit) are also available.

* Introduction to machine learning ([slides](slides/06_machine_learning.pdf))

**Homework:**
* **Optional:** Complete the bonus exercise listed in the [human learning notebook](notebooks/06_human_learning_iris.ipynb). It will take the place of any one homework you miss, past or future! This is due on Tuesday (9/8).
* If you're not using Anaconda, install [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/) and [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup) using `pip`. (Both of these packages are included with Anaconda.)

**Machine Learning Resources:**
* For a very quick summary of the key points about machine learning, watch [What is machine learning, and how does it work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk) (10 minutes) or read the [associated notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/01_machine_learning_intro.ipynb).
* For a more in-depth introduction to machine learning, read section 2.1 (14 pages) of Hastie and Tibshirani's excellent book, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). (It's a free PDF download!)
* The [Learning Paradigms](http://work.caltech.edu/library/014.html) video (13 minutes) from [Caltech's Learning From Data course](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) provides a nice comparison of supervised versus unsupervised learning, as well as an introduction to "reinforcement learning".
* [Real-World Active Learning](https://beta.oreilly.com/ideas/real-world-active-learning) is a readable and thorough introduction to "active learning", a variation of machine learning in which humans label only the most "important" observations.
* For a preview of some of the machine learning content we will cover during the course, read Sebastian Raschka's [overview of the supervised learning process](https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/machine_learning/supervised_intro/introduction_to_supervised_machine_learning.md).
* [Data Science, Machine Learning, and Statistics: What is in a Name?](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2013/04/data-science-machine-learning-and-statistics-what-is-in-a-name/) discusses the differences between these (and other) terms.
* [The Emoji Translation Project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fred/the-emoji-translation-project) is a really fun application of machine learning.
* Look up the [characteristics of your zip code](http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/tapestry/), and then read about the [67 distinct segments](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/data/tapestry-segmentation.htm) in detail.

**IPython Notebook Resources:**
* For a recap of the IPython Notebook introduction (and a preview of scikit-learn), watch [scikit-learn and the IPython Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXXlYVBt1M) (15 minutes) or read the [associated notebook](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/02_machine_learning_setup.ipynb).
* If you would like to learn the IPython Notebook, the official [Notebook tutorials](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Examples%20and%20Tutorials%20Index.ipynb) are useful.
* This [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3be5z2/do_you_prefer_ipython_notebook_over_ipython/) compares the relative strengths of the IPython Notebook and Spyder.

### Class 7: Getting Data
* Pandas homework with the IMDb data due ([solution](code/05_pandas_homework_imdb.py))
* Optional "human learning" exercise with the iris data due ([solution](notebooks/06_human_learning_iris.ipynb))
* APIs ([code](code/07_api.py))
    * [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
* Web scraping ([code](code/07_web_scraping.py))
    * [IMDb: robots.txt](http://www.imdb.com/robots.txt)
    * [Example web page](data/example.html)
    * [IMDb: The Shawshank Redemption](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/)

**Homework:**
* **Optional:** Complete the homework exercise listed in the [web scraping code](code/07_web_scraping.py). It will take the place of any one homework you miss, past or future! This is due on Tuesday (9/15).
* **Optional:** If you're not using Anaconda, [install Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/installing.html) using `pip`. If you're using Anaconda, install Seaborn by running `conda install seaborn` at the command line. (Note that some students in past courses have had problems with Anaconda after installing Seaborn.)

**API Resources:**
* This Python script to [query the U.S. Census API](https://github.com/laurakurup/census-api) was created by a former DAT student. It's a bit more complicated than the example we used in class, it's very well commented, and it may provide a useful framework for writing your own code to query APIs.
* [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore) and [Apigee](https://apigee.com/providers) allow you to explore tons of different APIs. Alternatively, a [Python API wrapper](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/api/list-of-python-apis) is available for many popular APIs.
* The [Data Science Toolkit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/) is a collection of location-based and text-related APIs.
* [API Integration in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/api-integration-in-python/) provides a very readable introduction to REST APIs.
* Microsoft's [Face Detection API](https://www.projectoxford.ai/demo/face#detection), which powers [How-Old.net](http://how-old.net/), is a great example of how a machine learning API can be leveraged to produce a compelling web application.

**Web Scraping Resources:**
* The [Beautiful Soup documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is incredibly thorough, but is hard to use as a reference guide. However, the section on [specifying a parser](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use) may be helpful if Beautiful Soup appears to be parsing a page incorrectly.
* For more Beautiful Soup examples and tutorials, see [Web Scraping 101 with Python](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/03/03/web-scraping-101-with-python/), a former DAT student's well-commented notebook on [scraping Craigslist](https://github.com/Alexjmsherman/DataScience_GeneralAssembly/blob/master/Final_Project/1.%20Final_Project_Data%20Scraping.ipynb), this [notebook](http://web.stanford.edu/~zlotnick/TextAsData/Web_Scraping_with_Beautiful_Soup.html) from Stanford's Text As Data course, and this [notebook](https://github.com/cs109/2014/blob/master/lectures/2014_09_23-lecture/data_scraping_transcript.ipynb) and associated [video](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/L07/screen_H264LargeTalkingHead-16x9.shtml) from Harvard's Data Science course.
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uHM_esB13VuSf7O1ScGueisnrtu-6usGFD3fs4z5YCE/edit#slide=id.p) and [code](https://github.com/kjam/python-web-scraping-tutorial) are also available.
* For more complex web scraping projects, [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is a popular application framework that works with Python. It has excellent [documentation](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/index.html), and here's a [tutorial](https://github.com/rdempsey/ddl-data-wrangling) with detailed slides and code.
* [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) has a concise explanation of how to write (and read) the `robots.txt` file.
* [import.io](https://import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code.
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid to Find True Love](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.
